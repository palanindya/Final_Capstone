# Final_Capstone
1.	We took a data set of 227 countries of the world consisting of various demographic and other features and GDP per capita.
2.	We loaded all the relevant packages in Python.
3.	We imported the data as a csv file in Python and found out the missing values.
4.	We imputed the missing values based on mean and mode.
5.	We performed data exploration through graphs
6.	We found correlation among numerical columns.
7.	We found out the top factors affecting GDP per capita and plotted the same.
8.	We performed label encoding of the categorical columns.
9.	We performed a split between test and train data.
10.	We used Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models to get the predicted target variable i.e. GDP per capita
11.	We calculated root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE) and mean square log error to know how well our model performs.
12.	We performed data visualization of GDP per capita observed(ground truth) and predicted by the model.
13.	We calculated GDP by multiplying population with GDP per capita and found out the major factors affecting the same.We found out the top 10 economies of the world and the sector wise composition of these economies.
